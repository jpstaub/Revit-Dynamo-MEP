	Problem: Crop image to contents and make background transparent.
	Sequence of steps:
		1. Load image from disk into memory
		2. Crop out daylight factor scale
		3. Grayscale the image
		4. Make a mask by turning grayscale into black & white image
		5. Make black background transparent.
		6. Find bounding box of mask
		7. Crop image
		8. Save result from memory to disk
