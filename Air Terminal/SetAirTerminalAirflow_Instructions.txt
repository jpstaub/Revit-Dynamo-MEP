Dynamo Graph: SetAirTerminalAirflow.dyn

Last Updated: 2018-12-28

Purpose: Divides Space-Wide airflows by the number of Air Terminals categorized by Duct System
         Type and asigns Discrete Airflows to the Air Terminals of the same Duct System Type.

Inputs:
1. Space Airflow Parameters of interest (ex. TRACE Calculated Diffuser Airflow)
2. Duct System Types that correspond with Space Airflow Parameters (ex. Supply Air)

Outputs:
None

Notes:
1. Space Airflow Parameters must correspond with Duct System Types in order.
2. Spaces must be placed in the Project.
3. Air Terminals must be placed in Spaces in the Project.
4. Air Terminals must be Connected to the appropriate Duct System Type. 
5. Airflow is divided equally among Air Terminals of the same Duct System Type in each space.
