Dynamo Graph: SetSpaceNumberIntoRooms.dyn

Purpose: Sets Space Numbers into a shared parameter <Space Number> in an ARCH project file so the Room Schedule in the MECH project file shows a correlation between MECH Spaces and ARCH Rooms.

Last Updated: 2018-12-28

Workflow:
1. Generate MECH model with Spaces as required.
2. Generate ARCH model with Rooms as required by linking MECH model as well as other background CAD files to guide placement and naming / numbering.
3. Add shared parameter <Space Number> to Room >> Identiy Data.
4. Run the script against the ARCH model.
5. Room shared parameter <Space Number> will populate with the space number under which the Room resides.

Inputs:
1. Selection of the linked MECH file.

Outputs:
None

Notes:
1. The shared parameter <Space Number> must exist in order for Dynamo to write data to the parameter.
2. To add the shared parameter <Space Number> to Rooms: Manage tab >> Project Parameters >> Add Shared Parameter >> Check Rooms >> Select <Space Number> from Space Group.
