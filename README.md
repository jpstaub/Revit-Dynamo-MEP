A series of graphs that automate the generation of conceptual masses based on space volume geometry. 

### TRACE700 (Tested - Revit 2021 / Dynamo 2.3):
Sets TRACE700 data from CSV file generated from TRACE700 Room Checksums into matching space parameters. See below for TRACE700 Room Checksums processor to produce required CSV file. 

## Python Scripts
### Trane TRACE700 Room Checksums Full Processor (Tested - Windows10 / Python 2.7):
